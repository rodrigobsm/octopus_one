# about the source-code files

- octupus_one.ino: This is our first implementation of this onboard computer. It uses a LCD Shield and some other fancy stuff you may want to have in case you need a more elaborated data logger for your HAB flight!
- 
- octopus_two.ino: This is our second implementation of this onboard computer which we have removed the LCD Shield and some other small components in order to decrease weight and increase simplicity. Tip: If you're only looking for a simple and powerfull data-logger, go for this one!
