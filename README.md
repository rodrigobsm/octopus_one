# octopus_one
This is a project of a onboard computer or sonde used to collect and log to a file, with many informations about weather, very used by weather ballons (HAB). It was built under Arduino Mega platform and uses many sensors to collect the data. This project is part of an academic discipline from UNIFEOB, a Brazilian technology university where I was acting as professor, and it's open-source under Creative Commons license.

# about the source-code files

- octupus_one.ino: This is our first implementation of this onboard computer. It uses a LCD Shield and some other fancy stuff you may want to have in case you need a more elaborated data logger for your HAB flight!

- octopus_two.ino: This is our second implementation of this onboard computer which we have removed the LCD Shield and some other small components in order to decrease weight and increase simplicity. Tip: If you're only looking for a simple and powerfull data-logger, go for this one!
